		<p>Coding can be defined as writing instructions for computers and other hardware. The computer is then able to read the instructions (called “programs”) and do what you have asked it to do.
			Computer language is different from human language. A human needs to learn “computer language” (commonly known as programming languages) to write programs that the computer can understand.
			Coding is the process of transforming ideas, solutions, and instructions into the language that the computer can understand – that is, binary-machine code.
			Coding is how humans are able to talk with computers.
			Coding involves communicating and giving instructions for different actions we want our computers to perform using a computer programming language.
			<br>Computers use compilers and interpreters to convert programs into what’s known as machine-readable code. 
			“Machine code” is information stored in zeros and ones (binary digits). 
			A person who writes programs is called a coder or programmer.
			<br>Coding and programming are usually used interchangeably. But is that correct? We will be comparing both at the end to clear up.

		<h3><strong>What Are The Basics Of Coding?</strong></h3>
		<p>There are 4 basics of coding as follow: </p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Algorithms:</b> An Algorithm is a list of steps followed in order to complete a task(run a program).</li>
			<li><b>Syntax:</b> Syntax refers to the specific structure, grammar,and punctauation rules that must be followed for that programing language.</li>
			<li><b>Functions/Methods/Parameters/Arguments.</b></li>	
			<li><b>Operators.</b></li>
		</ol>
		<h3><strong>What are the Types of Coding?</strong></h3>
		<p>While the names of the coding paradigms sometimes vary, most experts agree on four primary types of code: imperative, functional, logical, and object-oriented. Alternative names and other primary types may include procedural, scripting, and database <mark>programming</mark>.</p>

		<h2><center>What Is Programming?</center></h2>
		<p align="center"><i> "Programming is the implementation of logic to facilitate specified computing operations and functionality. It occurs in one or more languages, which differ by application, domain and programming model".</i></p>
		<p align="center"><img src="https://www.mastersoftwaresolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bnr-1.png"></p>
		<br>
		<p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.</p>
		<p>A programming language is a set of instructions that can be used to interact with and control a computer. These languages are used to design websites, create apps, develop operating systems, control spacecraft, and analyze data. Programming languages are necessary because computers can't understand Engish. Programming languages bridge this gap by helping programmers translate their commands into something that the computer can understand and execute.</p>

		<h4><strong>What Are The Basic Concepts Of Programming? </strong></h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Variable declaration</li>
			<li>Basic syntax</li>
			<li>Data type and structures</li>
			<li>Flow control structures (Conditionals and loops)</li>		
			<li>Functional programming</li>
			<li>Object-oriented programming</li>
			<li>Debugging</li>
			<li><abbr title=" Integrated Development Environment ">IDEs</abbr> and coding environments<sub>which is discussed at the end </sub></li>
		</ul>
		<h4><strong>What Are The Types Of Programming? </strong></h4>
		<p>There are many types of programming because different problems need different tools for soution. Some of them are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Procedural-Oriented Programming Language.</li>
			<li>Functional Programming Language.</li>
			<li>Problem-Oriented Programming Language.</li>
			<li>Scripting Programming Language.</li> 
			<li>Artificial Intelligence Programming Language.</li>

		<h2 align="center">Difference Between <sup>Computer</sup>Coding & Programming </h2>
		<p align="center"><i>'Coding is a part of programming that deals with writing codes that a machine can understand. Programming is a process that creates programs that involve the ratification of codes'.</i></P>
		<p align="center"><img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/difference-between-coding-and-programming.jpg"></p>
		<ul align="center">
			<li>Coding deals with writing code in a language understood by both machines and humans. The main aim of coding is to provide communication between the two (humans & computers).</li> 
			<br>
			<li>Programming involves creating an outline and structure for the program’s code that follows certain standards, before the actual code is written to preform the task it needs to perform.</li>
		</ul>	
			<br>
		<p>In the First section, we saw that the terms <i>“coding”</i> and <i>“programming”</i> can be used interchangeably. This is because both involve writing programs. 
			The two terms, however, differ in terms of their scope. In addition to writing code, a programmer is also involved in high-level problem-solving. 
			<br>
			For example, a programmer might advise on the technologies that should be used in a project. This is because they have things like security and scalability in mind. 
			A coder’s responsibility, on the other hand, will involve writing code that results in a certain user story being fulfilled.
			<br>
			For example, if the user story is that Alex should be able to receive an email when they click the “forgot password” button, a coder will write a program to help Alex retrieve their password.
			A programmer will need to take a factor like scalability into consideration when choosing the database to be used to store Alex’s data.
